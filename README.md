### Vision
Traveling is my greatest passion and I've always wanted to create my own travel website. I created the 20 Something Travels landing page as a part of a long term project to showcase my travels. The purpose of the landing page is to give users a taste of my travel brand.

### Links

- Live Site URL: []


### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Bootstrap 5

### What I learned

This project expanded my knowledge of CSS background images, background gradients, and box shadows. I experimented with a hero image below the navigation bar, adding layered images to create a 3D effect. I also applied a background gradient to a few sections to elevate the content. Lastly, I ventured beyond the traditional box shadow format and utilized layered
box shadows to create a softer, smoother effect.


### Continued development
I hope to build out the project into multiple webpages featuring blogs.

What I loved most about the project:
-Being able to share my travel experiences
-Implementing linear gradients
-Creating a CSS animated button
